# ragnarok

Terminal utility based on dialog for ODIN protocol validator nodes.
Please understand this utility is in very early stages and is a work in progress.
All you should need to do is install git and dialog if they are not already present in the system, clone the repo, and run the primary script.

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git dialog
git clone https://GitHub.com/iprouteth0/ragnarok
cd ragnarok && ./ragnarok
```

I'll likely be updating it frequently, so keep an eye on the repo activity.
